## #binaryString
**\#binaryString** is a freestanding macro that will convert an Integer literal into a binary string representation:
```swift
let x = #binaryString(10)
/*
expanded code:
"1010"
*/
print(x) // Output: "1010"
```
> This macro was created as a tutorial to explain how macros work actually. It would be simpler to create a function to do this instead :). Learn more here: TBD
